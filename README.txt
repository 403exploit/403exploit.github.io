Through this site I try my best to convey and understand the vulnerabilities till its real depths.
Obviously, I am no expert exploit developer or something so the blogs present in my sites, you may find some related content n other blogs too becaus I have read about vulnerabilities froom various resources and then have presented in front of you through my website.

Suggestions and Feedbacks are always welcome!
